Client-Server architecture 

User(agent)-->Client(Web Browser)
           -->URL(End Point)
                     --->Protocol
                         Path(domain, param, query)
            eg. protocol://domain/path/?key=value&key_1=value

Server(responder)
   --->response on the basis of request of Client
   first thing that server looks is protocol
   if, https:sends html to browser,FTP sends file download to browser, smtp: mail, tailnet:remote connection

all protocol are assigned specific number in server known as port number
port number are 1-2^16-1
some server has default port number as below
http--80
https--443

client    server      |request response cycle should be completed if not
req ===== res         |server gives status code

status code
100 range => Information range
200 range => Response success/ok
300       => Redirect 
400       => Error / resource 
500       => Server / Error e.g gives badgateway due to insufficient bandwidth 

Web architecture 
MVC (3 tier architecture) (we also have 2 tier only model and view)
Model ----Data base design                              |view calls controller
View  ------output representation                       |controller talks to model
controller---connects view and model(brain of software) 

Method of communication between client and server
RESTful services  || it is stateless service
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE (also known as http verbs, restful service method, client-service method)
// Javascript has all 5 but someother language has only GET and POST



API -- Application Programming Interface-------It is a interaction between software.
(e.g User Interface is a interaction between user and software where as API is a interaction between software (client server interaction)).
Suppose we have mobile app, same app has desktop app, mobile app, desktop app

Mobile 


Web app                    Api(communicator)                                          Server =============== Database
eg(Ecommerce)                 key/endpoint(Url)
                   we send data to enpoint
Desktop            of esewa
                   they send back json data
                   to browers(json is a universal data format which can be read by all programming language which is also known as language independent data-format)











http and https
https has a security layer remember meat shop gives two polythene bag, during hosting we have to buy ssl certificate 

(Secure Sockets Layer)
If a website is asking users to sign in, enter personal details such as their credit card numbers, 
or view confidential information such as health benefits or financial information, 
then it is essential to keep the data confidential. 
SSL certificates help keep online interactions private and assure users that the website is authentic and safe to share private information with.
